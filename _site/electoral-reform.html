<div class="intro">
  <h2 id="part1">Introduction: a criticism of FPTP</h2>
  <div class="text-block">
    <b>First-past-the-post</b> — the electoral system that the UK uses for its parliamentary elections — is notorious for being very disproportional in its allocation of
    seats compared to popular vote.
    In 2019, Boris Johnson's Conservatives won a landslide mandate to "Get Brexit Done" winning 365 out of 650 seats in Parliament — 40 seats above the threshold for a majority.
    However, they did not receive the majority of the vote from the British populace. While receiving 43.6% of the popular vote is incredible for one party in UK politics
    (the highest percentage in 40 years, in fact), it remains that the majority of Britain's electorate did not choose the Conservatives and thus they should not have received
    a majority of seats in Parliament.
    <br>
    <br>
    While the 2019 result was certainly bad in terms of proportionality, things only got worse in 2024. According to Wikipedia, the 2024 general election was the least proportional
    election in history, with Keir Starmer's Labour winning 411 out of 650 seats with only 33.7% of the popular vote. That's nearly <i>two-thirds</i> of the seats being represented by 
    <i>one-third</i>  of voters.
    On the flip side, smaller parties receive far fewer seats than their vote count suggests they should.
    14.3% of people in 2024 voted for Nigel Farage's Reform UK, which ideally should give the party 93 seats.
    In reality, Reform got 5.
    The story is the same for the Green Party: 6.4% of the votes receiving a mere 4 seats, or 0.6% of Parliament.
    <br>
    <br>
    The current system inevitably leads British politics into a two-party system, and punishes people who support smaller parties, since general elections are really just
    hundreds of small, local elections, each with exactly one winner — the local MP.
    So if you're, say, a supporter of the Greens and you don't happen to live in exceptionally Green-voting places like Brighton or Bristol, you're out of luck 
    because your local Green candidate likely has no chance of winning.
    Same goes for Lib Dems in most places outside of the West Country and the South East, or for Reform in much of Scotland.
    Therefore, you're more likely to tactically vote against one of the two parties that actually does have a chance of winning your constituency (the "lesser of two evils" so to speak),
    rather than for the candidate of the party you like the most.
    This matters because the UK's voting tendencies resemble those of many European democracies much more rather than a true two-party system like the United States.
    Our major parties do not get sweeping majorities, tending to get 30-40% of the vote, with our third, fourth, and fifth parties usually at around 5-15%.
    And yet representation in Parliament still does not reflect this (see diagrams below).

<div class="body">
    <h2 id="part2">An alternative system</h2>
    <div class="text-block">
        An alternative system I'm proposing the UK could use instead is one I'm going to call "<b>proportional representation with multi-member constituencies</b> 
        using the <b>D'Hondt method</b> of apportionment" — a very wordy title but it's the system that countries like Finland and Poland use.
        The way it works is as follows:
        <br>
        1)  Instead of each constituency having just one winner who got the most votes, each constituency sends <i>multiple</i> MPs to Parliament, proportional to how the electorate in that
        constituency voted, allocated using the <i>D'Hondt method</i> (explained in detail later).
        <br>
        2)  Inside each constituency, there is a <i>party list</i> — for each party there is a list of local candidates from that party on the ballot.
        In an open-list system (like in Finland or Poland), the voter selects exactly one candidate from one party (or one independent).
        In a closed-list system, the voter simply selects one party (or one independent), and the party decides the order of candidates in which the seats they win are filled.
        In practice, both systems have their advantages and disadvantages — it could be argued that while an open list allows voters to pick individual candidates (e.g. ones with
        their preferred political views or ones from their local area) giving very local and personal accountability, many voters may simply just care about the party they pick, 
        not any specific candidate from a long list.
        For this analysis however, whether an open-list, a closed-list, or a hybrid, is chosen makes no difference — it merely uses overall party votes from the actual election
        and recalculates them under the new PR system.
        In my ideal scenario, I'd imagine it being either an open-list or a hybrid where candidate order is fixed but it is disclosed on the ballot and candidates being fielded 
        must be from the constituency for at least some level of local representation.
        <br>
        <br>
        My main argument for this system is that it is a simple system that compromises between perfect proportional representation (which would mean simply tallying up the votes 
        nationwide and allocating seats based on that) and the one advantage of the current FPTP system which is local representation.
        When drawing constituency boundaries for this system, I tried to follow county/regional lines as closely as possible so that the British electorate is always represented
        by someone from their area — perhaps not as immediate of an area as under FPTP but still from your area who (hopefully) understands the needs of the region.
        <br>
        <br>Example:
        <br>
        Imagine yourself as a resident of the town of Chesterfield in Derbyshire.
        In the 2024 FPTP election, the local Labour candidate won with 46% of the vote, meaning if you're part of the remaining 54% (a majority!) of voters in your area, you have no local
        representation.
        In fact your county as a whole, which has 11 MPs, despite voting 40% for Labour, sent 11/11 Labour MPs to Parliament. 40% of the votes speak for 100% of the population.
        Now under the new system, you get to vote for which 11 MPs will represent Derbyshire as a whole.
        Using 2024 election data, Derbyshire now sends 5 Labour, 4 Conservative, and 2 Reform MPs (with Lib Dems and Greens not making the cut for one seat).
        <br>
        <br>
        The exact methodology, rules, and critical analysis for this new system are detailed later, but as a summary, here is what the 2024 UK general election would 
        look like under the new system. Note the differences between popular vote, seats under FPTP, and seats under multi-member PR.

<div class="body">
    <h2 id="part3">Methodology</h2>
    <div class="text-block">
        1. Drawing electoral boundaries
        <br>
        Electoral boundaries should try to follow existing cultural/administrative boundaries that British people are familiar with (their county, for example) as best as possible.
        For the sake of it being the only available voting data, I combined existing FPTP constituencies to form the new ones.
        They generally tend to follow county boundaries (which is good) but there are a few inconsistencies that arose when electoral boundaries were redrawn for the 2024 election
        not always following county boundaries.
        So for the purposes of this map we have Tiverton being lumped into Somerset, Bordon into Surrey, Malmesbury into Gloucestershire, Wetherby into North Yorkshire, and a couple
        others. 
        <br>
        <br>
        2. Constituency size
        <br>
        One of my first observations upon working on this project is that the more seats a constituency has, the more closely allocated seats proportionally match popular vote
        (an explanation as to why is under the <i>Critical analysis of results</i> section), so larger constituencies are favourable for proportionality reasons.
        However, as explained earlier, a larger constituency may detract from the local/regional representation aspect so the compromise I decided on is to limit the minimum
        constituency size to 4 seats and the maximum to 20 seats (a 75-seat London constituency would be ridiculous, as would a 1-seat Shetland & Orkney constituency).
        This meant that some big counties had to be split apart and some small ones combined with others.
        <br>
        <ul class="center-list">
            <li>County Armagh (2 seats) — combined with County Down (6 seats) to form Armagh & Down</li>
            <li>County Derry/Londonderry, County Fermanagh, and County Tyrone — combined to form West Ulster</li>
            <li>Gwynedd (2 seats) — combined with Clwyd (5 seats) to form Dyfed & Powys</li>
            <li>Herefordshire (2 seats) — combined with Worcestershire (6 seats) to form Hereford & Worcester</li>
            <li>Isle of Wight (2 seats) — combined with Hampshire (18 seats) to form Hampshire & Isle of Wight</li>
            <li>Powys (2 seats) — combined with Dyfed (4 seats) to form Dyfed & Powys</li>
            <li>Rutland (0.5 seats) — already too small for one, combined with Leicestershire (10.5 seats) to form Leicestershire & Rutland</li>
            <li>Angus, Dundee, and Perth and Kinross — combined to form Angus & Perthshire</li>
            <li>Middle four constituencies of Scotland that make up Falkirk, West Lothian, and parts of Clackmannanshire — combined to form Forth as no other clean way to group them</li>
            <li>Argyll and Bute, Highlands, Orkney, Outer Hebrides, Moray, and Shetland — combined to form Highlands & Islands as no other clean way to group them</li>
            <li>Five southernmost constituencies of Scotland — combined to form South Scotland as no other clean way to group them</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="center-list">
            <li>Greater London (75 seats) — split following ONS International Territorial Level (previously EU NUTS-2) regions into 
                Inner London East (17 seats) covering Hackney, Haringey, Islington, Lambeth, Lewisham, Newham, Southwark, and Tower Hamlets;
                Inner London West (9 seats) covering Camden, City of London, Hammersmith and Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea, Wandsworth, and Westminster;
                Outer London East (19 seats) covering Barking and Dagenham, Bexley, Enfield, Greenwich, Havering, Redbridge, and Waltham Forest;
                Outer London South (12 seats) covering Bromley, Croydon, Kingston upon Thames, Merton, and Sutton;
                and Outer London West (18 seats) covering Barnet, Brent, Ealing, Harrow, Hillingdon, Hounslow, and Richmond upon Thames
            </li>
            <li>Greater Manchester (27 seats) — split into Greater Manchester North (13 seats) covering Bolton, Bury, Oldham, Rochdale, and Wigan,
                and Greater Manchester South (14 seats) covering Manchester, Salford, Stockport, Tameside, and Trafford
            </li>
            <li>West Midlands (26 seats) — split into West Midlands East (15 seats) covering Birmingham, Coventry, and Solihull,
                and West Midlands West (11 seats) covering Dudley, Sandwell, Walsall, and Wolverhampton
            </li>
            <li>West Yorkshire (22 seats) — split into West Yorkshire East (11 seats) covering Leeds and Wakefield,
                and West Yorkshire West (11 seats) covering Bradford, Calderdale, and Kirklees
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="body">
    <h2 id="part4">Critical analysis of results</h2>
    <div class="text-block">
        For example, in a small 5 seat constituency each seat represents 20% of the total.
        There is a significant lack of granularity here so misrepresentation will be large as we are rounding up or down to the nearest 20%.
        In contrast, in a 16-seat constituency, each seat is worth only 6.25% of the total.
        Furthermore, because larger parties are slightly overrepresented 
    </div>
</div>

<div class="body">
    <h2 id="part5">What about independents?</h2>
    <div class="text-block">
        It is worth pointing out that, in the map of results above, no independent candidates won seats in the election.
        That is not a flaw of the system, but rather a direct result of translating existing FPTP election data into multi-member PR.
        Since an independent candidate may only run for MP in one constituency, their vote count is limited, thus under multi-member PR they have virtually no chance of 
        having enough votes county/region-wide to qualify for even one seat.
        In practice under my proposed system, independent candidates would of course run to represent the county/regional constituency as a whole (e.g. Jeremy Corbyn — an independent in
        2024 — would have run for all of Inner London East rather than Islington North) and take part in the same allocation process as the other parties.
        Note that in the case a very popular independent candidate were to receive enough votes to allocate them two or more seats, they remain capped at one seat and those
        subsequent seats go to the next largest party in that allocation round.

        Here we see that the popular independent candidate should have gotten a second seat in round 7 based on number of votes, but since an independent cannot take more than
        one seat, it goes to the next largest party in that round (Party C).

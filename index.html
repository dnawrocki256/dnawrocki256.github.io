  <h2>About me</h2>
  <div class="text-block">
    Hi, I'm Dawid, a Polish computer science undergraduate student and geospatial data enthusiast based in the United Kingdom.
    <br>
    <br>
    My primary area of interest lies at the intersection of my formal computer science studies and my passion for mapping and visualising the world around us.
    I have experience in Python and QGIS, which I use to process and manipulate geographical datasets.
    I have also worked with SQL in both my degree and personal projects, and I'm currently developing my skills in the Python libraries pandas (specifically geopandas) 
    and matplotlib for data analysis and visualisation.
